Alan Hietala's HackDay 2013 App: What's Up Frige
===============================

This was the first app I wrote for the linkedin HackDay 2013 event. It wasn't presented at the event since I had to leave early but I hope people can learn something from it. 


Purpose
=================

This app takes an agile approach to fridge inventory. Most people don't measure the contents of their fridge in grams, ml but more in terms of "do I have enough". What's up fridge uses this same approach. 

User accounts weren't quite hooked up in time so it really operates on a single account right now. 

You can see the app running at: http://stark-oasis-7090.herokuapp.com/
